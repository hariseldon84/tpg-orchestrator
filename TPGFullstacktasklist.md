## SUMMARY

### Current State
- **TPGFullstack.md:** 1,952 lines (65KB)
- **Target:** 10,000+ lines (400KB+)
- **Gap:** ~8,000 lines (80% of content missing)

### Total Lines to Add by Phase
| Phase | Category | Lines to Add | Priority |
|-------|----------|--------------|----------|
| 1 | Agents (FULL versions) | ~1,345 | HIGH |
| 2 | Tasks (complete all 14) | ~2,460 | HIGH |
| 3 | Templates (complete all 16) | ~2,030 | HIGH |
| 4 | Checklists (complete all 10) | ~1,280 | MEDIUM |
| 5 | Workflows (complete all 6) | ~710 | MEDIUM |
| 6 | Data files (excerpts) | ~4,000 | CRITICAL |
| 7 | Utils (complete all 3) | ~1,370 | HIGH |
| **TOTAL** | **All Content** | **~13,195 lines** | - |

### Projected Final Size
1,952 (current) + 13,195 (to add) = **~15,147 lines total**

This aligns better with BMAD's 10,000+ line standard (we may exceed it due to TPG having more files: 66 vs BMAD's 75).

## TRACKING RULES

1. **After completing each module**, update this file first before moving to next module
2. **Mark tasks** with ✅ when done, ⚠️ when in progress, ❌ when pending
3. **Update line counts** if actual differs from estimate
4. **Document any issues** encountered during copying/modification
5. **Test incrementally** after each major module to catch issues early

---

## NOTES

### Why This Systematic Approach?

1. **Context Preservation** - If credits run out, new agent can pick up exactly where we left off
2. **Progress Visibility** - User can see what's done vs. pending at any time
3. **Quality Control** - Testing after each module catches issues early
4. **Alignment** - User and agent stay synchronized on progress

### BMAD Comparison

BMAD exampleteamfullstack.md structure:
- 10,000+ lines
- 407KB file size
- All agents, tasks, templates, checklists, workflows, data files in FULL
- No abbreviations or summaries

TPG Target:
- Match or exceed BMAD's comprehensiveness
- Include all 66 files vs. BMAD's subset
- Maintain FULL content, not summaries
- Estimated 15,000+ lines when complete

**Last Updated:** December 31, 2025
**Status:** Ready to begin systematic completion
**Next Step:** Module 1 - Data Files (await user confirmation)
