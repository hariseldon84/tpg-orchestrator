# Genome Coherence Checklist

## Purpose

To validate cross-DNA coherence and ensure all 6 DNAs work together harmoniously. This checklist identifies conflicts, gaps, and misalignments across the Product Genome.

## DNA Pair Coherence Validation

### Purpose ↔ User DNA Coherence
- [ ] User segments align with Purpose DNA scope
- [ ] Primary user segment matches purpose focus
- [ ] User JTBDs align with purpose objectives
- [ ] Serving these users will achieve the purpose
- [ ] User needs align with north star metric
- [ ] No conflicts between user needs and purpose

**Score:** _[1-5]_ **Status:** _[Strong / Moderate / Weak]_

### User ↔ Experience DNA Coherence
- [ ] Experience standards serve user needs
- [ ] Quality thresholds match user expectations
- [ ] UX patterns fit user context and constraints
- [ ] Accessibility standards appropriate for user segments
- [ ] Performance standards match user environment
- [ ] Experience respects user constraints (offline, mobile, etc.)

**Score:** _[1-5]_ **Status:** _[Strong / Moderate / Weak]_

### Purpose ↔ Experience DNA Coherence
- [ ] Experience standards support purpose achievement
- [ ] Quality gates aligned with north star metric
- [ ] MQB gates protect purpose from erosion
- [ ] User experience delivers on purpose promise
- [ ] Meeting experience standards drives purpose success

**Score:** _[1-5]_ **Status:** _[Strong / Moderate / Weak]_

### Architecture ↔ Experience DNA Coherence
- [ ] Architecture enables Experience DNA standards
- [ ] Architecture can deliver performance thresholds
- [ ] Architecture supports accessibility requirements
- [ ] Architecture choices justified by experience needs
- [ ] No experience promises architecture can't support

**Score:** _[1-5]_ **Status:** _[Strong / Moderate / Weak]_

### Architecture ↔ User DNA Coherence
- [ ] Architecture respects user constraints
- [ ] Offline-first if users work offline
- [ ] Mobile-optimized if users are mobile
- [ ] Architecture decisions driven by user needs
- [ ] Technology choices fit user environment

**Score:** _[1-5]_ **Status:** _[Strong / Moderate / Weak]_

### Intelligence ↔ Purpose DNA Coherence
- [ ] North star metric from Purpose DNA is tracked
- [ ] Intelligence DNA metrics measure purpose achievement
- [ ] Instrumenting what matters for purpose
- [ ] Can measure whether purpose is being achieved

**Score:** _[1-5]_ **Status:** _[Strong / Moderate / Weak]_

### Intelligence ↔ User DNA Coherence
- [ ] User behavior and satisfaction tracked
- [ ] Metrics cover all key user segments
- [ ] Can measure success of user JTBDs
- [ ] Tracking what users care about
- [ ] User success is measurable

**Score:** _[1-5]_ **Status:** _[Strong / Moderate / Weak]_

### Intelligence ↔ Experience DNA Coherence

**Score:** _[1-5]_ **Status:** _[Strong / Moderate / Weak]_

### Cultural ↔ Purpose DNA Coherence
- [ ] Cultural values reinforce purpose
- [ ] Team rituals support purpose focus
- [ ] Decision-making practices align with purpose
- [ ] Culture supports purpose achievement
- [ ] Celebrate behaviors that serve purpose
- [ ] Cultural practices prevent purpose drift

**Score:** _[1-5]_ **Status:** _[Strong / Moderate / Weak]_

### Cultural ↔ Experience DNA Coherence
- [ ] Culture values quality (MQB compliance)
- [ ] Team rituals support quality standards
- [ ] "Saying no to low quality" is celebrated
- [ ] Quality culture deeply embedded
- [ ] MQB gates culturally supported

**Score:** _[1-5]_ **Status:** _[Strong / Moderate / Weak]_
