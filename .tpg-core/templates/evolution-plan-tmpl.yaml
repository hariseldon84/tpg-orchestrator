    title: Current State Assessment
    instruction: |
      Describe current product maturity and health.
    type: paragraph
    examples:
      - "We're in the 'Product-Market Fit' stage with 500 active users (target segment: field maintenance technicians). North star metric (average repair time) is 120 minutes vs. target of 60 minutes. Product Genome health score: 4.2/5.0 (strong). MQB compliance: 98%. Key strengths: clear purpose, validated user needs, strong technical foundation. Key gaps: instrumentation incomplete, cultural practices inconsistent."
