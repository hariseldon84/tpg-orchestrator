    title: User DNA Overview
    instruction: |
      Provide a high-level overview of who you're building for and why user understanding is critical for this product.
    elicit: true
    type: paragraph
    examples:
      - "This product serves field maintenance technicians who repair IoT-enabled equipment in retail locations. Understanding these users—their context, constraints, skills, and jobs-to-be-done—is essential because they work in high-pressure, low-connectivity environments where poor UX literally costs money and creates frustration. We don't build for 'everyone' or generic 'users.' We build for field technicians specifically."

  - id: user-segments
    title: User Segments
    instruction: |
      Define distinct user segments based on meaningful differences in needs, behaviors, context, or constraints. Segments should be:
      - Based on evidence (research, data, observation)
      - Mutually exclusive (users fit clearly in one segment)
      - Specific enough to guide different product decisions
      - Limited in number (3-5 segments max for focus)

      CRITICAL: Building for "everyone" means building for no one. Choose your segments deliberately.
    elicit: true
    sections:
      - id: primary-segment
        title: Primary User Segment
        repeatable: false
        instruction: |
          Identify the ONE primary segment you're optimizing for first. This is your focus.
        template: |
          **Segment Name:** {{segment_name}}

          **Who They Are:** {{description}}

          **Why Primary:** {{rationale_for_primary}}

          **Population Size:** {{estimated_size}}

          **Strategic Importance:** {{business_value}}
        examples:
          - |
            **Segment Name:** Field Maintenance Technicians (Primary)

            **Who They Are:** Mobile technicians who travel to retail locations to diagnose and repair IoT-enabled coolers and vending machines. They typically handle 3-6 service calls per day across a geographic territory.

            **Why Primary:** They are the bottleneck in equipment uptime. If they work faster and more accurately, the entire business benefits. They also have the most acute pain with current solutions.

            **Population Size:** ~2,000 active technicians across the service region

            **Strategic Importance:** Their efficiency directly impacts revenue (equipment uptime), costs (reduced return visits), and customer satisfaction (faster restoration).

          **Priority Level:** {{priority}}
        examples:
          - |
            **Segment Name:** Senior Technicians / Team Leads

            **Who They Are:** Experienced technicians who mentor others and handle escalated complex repairs

            **Needs Difference from Primary:** Need advanced diagnostic capabilities, prefer more technical detail, use product as teaching tool for junior technicians

            **Priority Level:** Secondary - support them but don't compromise primary segment UX
