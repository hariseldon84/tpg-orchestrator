  - id: epic-vision
    title: Epic Vision
    instruction: |
      Describe the strategic vision and outcome of this epic.
    elicit: true
    type: paragraph
    examples:
      - "Transform diagnostic accuracy and speed by providing technicians with AI-powered diagnostic suggestions based on real-time sensor data, historical repair patterns, and equipment-specific knowledge. This epic aims to reduce average repair time from 150 minutes to 90 minutes by enabling technicians to diagnose issues in under 5 minutes."

  - id: purpose-alignment
    title: Purpose Alignment
    instruction: |
      How does this epic serve Purpose DNA?
    elicit: true
    type: paragraph
    examples:
      - "This epic directly serves our north star metric: reducing average repair time. It addresses the Purpose DNA objective of 'eliminating technician frustration through intelligent assistance.' By achieving 60-minute average repair time (from current 150 min), we move significantly toward our 12-month target."

  - id: user-need
    title: User Need
    instruction: |
      What user problem does this epic solve?
    elicit: true
    type: paragraph
    examples:
      - "Field technicians spend 40% of repair time diagnosing issues (interviews with 30 technicians). Current troubleshooting guides are generic and don't leverage equipment-specific data. Technicians want intelligent, contextual guidance that helps them pinpoint issues quickly without trial-and-error or calling support."

  - id: success-criteria
    title: Success Criteria
    instruction: |
      How do we measure epic success?
    elicit: true
    type: numbered-list
    examples:
      - "Average diagnostic time ≤ 5 minutes (down from 60 minutes)"
      - "Diagnostic accuracy ≥ 95% (correct diagnosis on first attempt)"
      - "Technician confidence score ≥ 4.5/5 (post-repair survey)"
      - "First-visit fix rate ≥ 75% (up from 60%)"
      - "80% of technicians use AI suggestions in every diagnostic session"

  - id: stories
    title: User Stories (Level 2)
    instruction: |
      List the user stories that comprise this epic.
    type: table
    columns: [Story ID, Title, Status, Priority, Estimate]
    examples:
      - ["STORY-101", "View real-time sensor data in diagnostic interface", "Done", "P0", "8 pts"]
      - ["STORY-102", "Receive AI-powered diagnostic suggestions", "In Progress", "P0", "13 pts"]
      - ["STORY-103", "Access equipment-specific repair procedures", "Backlog", "P1", "5 pts"]
      - ["STORY-104", "Track diagnostic accuracy and outcomes", "Backlog", "P2", "3 pts"]

  - id: dependencies
    title: Dependencies
    instruction: |
      What must be in place for this epic to succeed?
    type: bullet-list
    examples:
      - "IoT sensor data integration (Infrastructure team)"
      - "ML model training pipeline (Data Science team)"
      - "Equipment repair history database (complete backfill)"
      - "Mobile app performance optimization (prerequisite for real-time data)"

  - id: risks
    title: Risks and Mitigations
    type: table
    columns: [Risk, Impact, Mitigation]
    examples:
      - ["AI suggestions inaccurate", "High - damages trust", "Validate model accuracy ≥95%, allow technician override, track feedback"]
      - ["Sensor data unreliable", "High - blocks feature", "Graceful degradation, use historical data, clear offline messaging"]
      - ["Timeline slips due to ML complexity", "Medium - delays value", "MVP with rule-based suggestions first, enhance with ML later"]

  - id: metrics
    title: Metrics to Track
    type: bullet-list
    examples:
      - "North star metric: Average repair time"
      - "Diagnostic time (diagnosis phase only)"
      - "Diagnostic accuracy (correct vs. incorrect diagnosis)"
      - "AI suggestion usage rate"
      - "AI suggestion acceptance rate (technician follows suggestion)"
      - "First-visit fix rate"
